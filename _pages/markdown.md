_RA in Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, Advisor: Prof.Jie Zeng, USTC, China_
**Training : Synthesize Amorphous Cu Nanoparticles for Efficient CO<sub>2</sub> Electroreduction to Liquid fuels** &nbsp;&nbsp; 
_08/2021-11/2021_

- Repeated the experiment published on  _Adv. Mater._ 2018, _30_, 1–7
- Synthesized amorphous Cu (a-Cu) nanoparticles using tannic acid at room temperature, and crystallographic Cu (c-Cu) nanoparticles using NaBH4 and PVP
- Determined the concentration of as-synthesized Cu via ICP, gained the experience in how to use GC and NMR to analyze the yields of gas and liquid products, respectively
- Learned the basic research paradigm of electrocatalysis


**Project 1: Explore distance effect of single atoms on the stability of cobalt oxide OER catalysts** 
_05/2022-01/2023_
- Synthesized the Ir-Cu<sub>0.3</sub>Co<sub>2.7</sub>O<sub>4</sub> single atom catalyst (SACs) through high-temperature pyrolysis of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)
- Estimated average Ir-Ir distances on the exposed surface of SACs through HAADF-STEM image, and identified Ir distribution in catalyst by EDX elemental mapping
- Tested the electrocatalytic performance and the stability in acidic environment of each catalyst, and discovered the optimal Ir-Ir distances (~0.6 nm) for stable acidic OER
- DFT calculation indicated that shorter Ir-Ir distances (~0.56 nm at minimum) will inhibit the dissolution of cobalt oxide by increasing the migration energies of Co atom on the surface, which agreed well with our experimental results.

**Project 2:**  **Electrosynthesis of Oxalate using CO<sub>2</sub> over Pb-based Catalyst**
_12/2021-06/2023_
- Oxidized the Pb foils in air followed by H<sub>2</sub> reduction in tubular furnace to obtain large uniform high-index lead facets with more catalytic active sites
- Selected Et<sub>4</sub>NBF<sub>4</sub>-DMF as the aprotic electrolyte system to inhibit hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), thereby improving the selectivity of C-C coupling process
- Chose Zn foil as a sacrificial anode to precipitate the generated oxalate ion during the reaction, thus assisted the desorption of C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> and managed to maintain a high selectivity of CO<sub>2</sub>-to-C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> conversion
- Achieved a higher Faradic efficiency of oxalate (~90%) and a higher current (\>100mA vs -3.0V) than previously reported
- Gained a deeper understanding of CO2 reduction mechanism

**Project 3: Electrosynthesis of NH<sub>2</sub>OH via  plasma-electrochemical cascade pathway using N<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O**  
_12/2022-06/2023_
- Prepared the working electrode by magnetron sputtering Bi NPs onto carbon fiber paper
- Used plasma discharge device to convert N<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> into NO<sub>x</sub>, and NO<sub>x</sub> was then absorbed into water to form NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-<sup>
- Adopted an excess amount of CHOCOOH to capture as-electroreducted NH<sub>2</sub>OH into glyoxylic acid oxime
- The Bi NPs catalyst exhibit a high FE (73.4%) and selectivity (99.3%) towards NH<sub>2</sub>OH
- Project 2 and 3 were aimed to realize full electrosynthesis of glycine (CO<sub>2</sub>-(COOH)<sub>2</sub>CHOCOOH-NH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>COOH)

_Independent Project in Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, Advisor: Prof. Jie Zeng, USTC, China_

- Synthesized mono-dispersed Cu nanocrystals(NCs) via seed-growth mechanism using copper acetate as copper source, ascorbic acid as reductant, and PVP as surfactant
- Improved the purity and uniformity of Cu nanoparticles by decoupling the growth step from nucleation in a flow reactor
- Tuned the concentration of precursor and adjusted the ratio of copper source involved in each step to produce Cu nanoparticles of different sizes

- Encapsulate functional nanostructures (like Ag nanocubes and QDs) in ZIF-8 nanoparticles
- Try to use zwitterionic ligands (like lecithin) and ligand-exchange methods to bridge the gap between nanoparticles dispersible in polar and non-polar solvents, thereby loading perovskites in cage-like structure for enhanced stability
