I am a senior student at the School of Physics, [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/)ï¼Œmajoring in Condensed Matter Physics. I find the interdisciplinary field of Chemistry and Physics particularly intriguing. My research interests encompass:

- Nanotechnology for energy and electrocatalysis.
- Perovskite nanomaterials.
- Multifunctional nanomaterials.

I feel privileged to be under the guidance of [Prof.Jie Zeng](http://catalysis.ustc.edu.cn/zwjj/list.htm) at the Hefei National Research Center for Physical Sciences at the Microscale, USTC. Additionally, I am advised by [Prof. Ou Chen](https://chenlab.brown.edu/) in the Department of Chemistry at Brown University, where I currently work as a visiting student.

On this website, you can explore my CV, my personal experiences, and get to know different facets of me.
