I'm a senior student from School of Physics, [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/). My major is Condensed Matter Physics, and the interdiscipline of Chemistry and Physic is the most attractive field to me. My research interest includes:

- Nanotechnology for energy and electrocatalysis
- Perovskite nanomaterials
- Multifunctional nanomaterials

I'm very fortunate to be advised by [Prof.Jie Zeng](http://catalysis.ustc.edu.cn/zwjj/list.htm) of Hefei National Research Center for Physical Sciences at the Microscale, USTC. I'm also advised by [Prof. Ou Chen](https://chenlab.brown.edu/) of Department of Chemistry, Brown University, and I'm currently working in his lab as a visiting student.

In this website you can find my CV, my personal experience, and explore different sides of me. 

- Notice updated on 09/25/2023:
_Section "CV","Experience", "Publications" and "Contact" are good to use now. Other parts (Research, Awards) are still under construction._
