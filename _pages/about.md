I'm a senior student from School of Physics, [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/). Although my major is Condensed Matter Physics, the intersection of Chemistry, Physics and Materials science is the most attractive field to me. And my research interest includes electrocatalyst, nanotechnology and perovskites.

I'm very fortunate to be advised by [Prof.Jie Zeng](http://catalysis.ustc.edu.cn/zwjj/list.htm) of Hefei National Research Center for Physical Sciences at the Microscale, USTC. I'm also advised by [Prof. Ou Chen](https://chenlab.brown.edu/) of Department of Chemistry, Brown University, and I'm currently working in his lab as a visiting student.

In this website you can find my CV, my personal experience, and explore different sides of me. Section "CV", "Publications" and "Contact" are good to use now. Other parts (Experience, Research, Awards) are still under construction.
