Abstract
===

The ambient air contains abundant nitrogenous resources that are essential for amine synthesis. Unfortunately, the inert N2 with stable N≡N obstructs the direct synthesis of active nitrogenous compounds from the ambient air. Herein, we developed a sustainable plasma-electrochemical cascade pathway (PECP) powered by renewable electricity for electrosynthesizing one of the active nitrogenous compounds, hydroxylamine (NH2OH), directly from the ambient air and H2O. During the PECP, we obtained the nitrate (NO3-) solution with a concentration of as high as 120.1 mM. Subsequently, the NO3- solution was selectively electroreduced to NH2OH over Bi-based catalyst. Notably, the faradaic efficiency for NH2OH reached 81.0% at -1.0 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Moreover, we also obtained a state-of-the-art yield rate for NH2OH of 713.1 μmol cm-2 h-1 with selectivity for NH2OH of 99.3%. Theoretical studies revealed that the Bi(012) facet displayed weaker adsorption energy for the adsorbed NH2OH intermediate (*NH2OH) in comparison with other kinds of metallic facets, indicating that the Bi catalyst facilitates the desorption of *NH2OH. Meanwhile, the desorption of *NH2OH was much more favorable than the dissociation of *NH2OH on the Bi(012) facet, resulting in the highly selective formation of NH2OH over Bi-based catalysts.
