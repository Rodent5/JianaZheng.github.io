Abstract
===

Developing efficient and economical electrocatalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE). Cobalt oxides are considered promising non-precious OER catalysts due to their high activities. However, the severe dissolution of Co atoms in acid media leads to the collapse of crystal structure, which impedes their application in PEMWE. Here, we reported that introducing acid-resistant Ir single atoms into the lattice of spinel cobalt oxides can significantly suppress the Co dissolution and keep them highly stable during the acidic OER process. Combining theoretical and experimental studies, we revealed that the stabilizing effect induced by Ir heteroatoms exhibited a strong dependence on the distance of adjacent Ir single atoms, where the OER stability of cobalt oxides was continuously improved with decreasing the distance. When the distance was reduced to about 0.6 nm, the spinel cobalt oxides presented no obvious degradation over a 60-hour stability test for acidic OER, suggesting potential for practical applications.
